# McReverse
 Reverse engineered library for the **german** McDonald's API in Java 

### Gradle
```java
allprojects {
    repositories {
	...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```
```java
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.JicuNull:McReverse:main-SNAPSHOT'
}
```

## Connect and login
`McClient` connects to the McDonald's backend server and is used for all interactions with the server.
[README.md](README.md)
```java
McClient client = new McClient();
```
You can log in with an existing account by calling `login(email, password)`, where the default deviceId (75408e58622a88c6) is used.

**NOTE** A deviceId must first be confirmed before a login with it is successful.
```java
McClient client = new McClient();
client.login("test@example.org", "123456");
```
or using a custom deviceId
```java
McClient client = new McClient();
client.login("test@example.org", "123456", "deviceId");
```
